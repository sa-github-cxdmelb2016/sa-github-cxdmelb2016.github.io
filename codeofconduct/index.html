          All organisers, sponsors and attendees are required to follow the conference Code of Conduct. We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional and welcoming environment for all attendees.
        </p>
        <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
        <p>
          Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
        </p>
        <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a CAmper (Culture Amp employee) immediately. Conference staff can be identified as theyâ€™ll be wearing the bright blue branded t-shirts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
        </p>
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
          <h2>Be awesome to each other</h2>
